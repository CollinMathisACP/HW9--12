<p>
These example webpages display the vast potential CSS has to compliment the content of a webpage, or even change the vibe entirely.
All of these webpages contain the same content, so the layout, color schemes, etc. are responsible for how each one is perceived by
the reader.

<h2>My Favorite Page</h2>

<p>
On this page, the text is contained within a single box. For that reason, it uses z-index extensively in order to make sure that
the text is infront of the backgroung elements that contain it. Furthermore, because the page has multiple floating elements, some of
the other ones use the clear property, which prevents one or both sides of the element from floating.
